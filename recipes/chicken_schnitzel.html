    <p>
      Growing up, chicken schnitzel was a classic. I decided to make this dish
      oven-friendly using less oil, and an easier cleanup. This dish tastes
      great with potato salad, or mashed potatoes and a nice crisp salad. Tastes
      great the next day cold too! It's a family-favorite! Enjoy with fresh
      squeezed lemon juice.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as desired</li>
      <li>6 chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise (butterflied)</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Â¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 cups seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 large lemon, zested</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet
        with aluminum foil and drizzle olive oil over foil. Place baking sheet
        in preheated oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flatten chicken breasts so they are all about 1/4-inch thick. Season
        chicken with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix flour and paprika together on a large plate. Beat eggs with salt and
        pepper in a shallow bowl. Mix bread crumbs and lemon zest together on a
        separate large plate. Dredge each chicken piece in flour mixture, then
        egg, and then bread crumbs mixture and set aside in 1 layer on a clean
        plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove baking sheet from oven and arrange chicken in 1 layer on the
        sheet. Drizzle more olive oil over each piece of coated chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Flip chicken and continue
        baking until no longer pink in the center and the breading is lightly
        browned, 5 to 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
        the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
