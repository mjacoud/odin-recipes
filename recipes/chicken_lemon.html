      So classic, simple, and elegant, this chicken main is great for company or
      even just a stepped up weeknight dinner. Thyme and garlic flavor a white
      wine pan sauce that's finished with a splash of cream. "This will be my go
      to crowd pleaser from now on," says carolinacoop.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 chicken thighs</li>
      <li>6 chicken drumsticks</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground paprika</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
      <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ cup white wine</li>
      <li>½ cup chicken stock</li>
      <li>lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place chicken in a large bowl and coat generously with salt, pepper, and
        paprika.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken to the
        skillet in batches, skin-side down. Cook until skin is golden and
        crispy, about 2 minutes per batch. Remove chicken and place into a large
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add thyme and garlic to the skillet. Cook over medium heat until garlic
        is fragrant and lightly browned, about 1 minute. Whisk in flour slowly
        into a thick paste. Add wine, stock, lemon juice, and cream and bring to
        a simmer, about 5 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese and stir until melted.
        Pour sauce over chicken in the baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until chicken is not longer pink
        inside and juices run clear, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
